    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>What is okonomiyaki made of?</h3>
    <p>It's made with flour, eggs, tempura scraps (tenkasu), cabbage, and pork belly slices and topped with a variety of condiments like okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, dried seaweed, and dried bonito flakes. If you don't eat pork or prefer another protein choice, this dish is very adaptable.</p>
    <h3>How does okonomiyaki taste?</h3>
    <p>Its flavors—sweet and savory, spicy from bits of ginger, smoky with the flavor of dashi—were instantly recognizable (as they would be to anyone who grew up eating casual Japanese food), while the texture, simultaneously crunchy and creamy, hit all of my comfort food sweet spots.
